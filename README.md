# laravelblog
This blog uses disqus comment system and is fully powered by laravel.
I used basic concepts such as Migration, Seeding, Eloquent, The comment system, Blade template Engine and Emails.

If you know Laravel I dont need to teach you how to run this application.

Future improvements will include email notifications, observers and queues.
